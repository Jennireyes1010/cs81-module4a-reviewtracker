Reflection:
The most helpful aspect of the reading tracker tool was how it was structured,it used objecys and arrays to ensure all data was 
organized, making it clear what each section was for. It also gave me good practice on using line comments, I see this being useful 
especially when working on team projects. 

One confusing part for me was understanding tne mostReadBook() function because unlike the others, this function required two steps.
At first, it was intimidating to see how long the section was, but I took time to try to understand line by line.
